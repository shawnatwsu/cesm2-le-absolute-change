 # This Interactive Python Jupyter Notebook looks at the spatial and ensemble distribution for Absolute Change between two climatological periods of 1991-2020 and 2031-2060 using the CESM2-LE. 
 # To perform this you first must calculate and create an .nc file for your climatological periods.
 # The second snippet shows the variability per ensemble using the Seaborn box plots to visualize the change for each enesmeble.
